summary    : A file system driver for WebDAV
description: |
    davfs2 is a Linux file system driver that allows you to mount a WebDAV
    resource into your Unix file system tree. So - and that is what makes
    davfs2 different - applications can use it without knowing about WebDAV.
    You may edit WebDAV resources using standard applications that interact
    with the file system as usual.
